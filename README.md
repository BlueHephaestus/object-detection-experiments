#Description

The code in this repo was used to prepare the object detector in the [LIRA Project](https://github.com/DarkElement75/lira), and also for tons of experiments and scripts relating to object detection - specifically with the method "Histogram of Oriented Gradients". As a result of the "random experimentation" nature of this repo, the code isn't very optimized or well documented. However, I do provide a pdf with my notes on the entire method, which I think explain it to the fundamentals very well.

Of course, feel free to contact me for any questions you have, or data used.
